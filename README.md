# SteamBadger
Steam Badger is a web application that uses the Steam API to generate a list of unfinished achievements.  The list is ordered by easiest to hardest using the percentage globally completed.

##Current Progress
I've got a working prototype that will display all the unfinished achievements, sorted by easiest to hardest using the percentage globally completed.  However, I created this project a year ago and need to fix up the code.  You can find the working code in the development branch.  Be warned, a lot of the code will be changed.  Use it only as a reference for using the steam API.
